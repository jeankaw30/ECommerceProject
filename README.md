QUARTER PROJECT

This repository is for my Advanced ASP.NET course quarter project. 
My project is an ecommerce site for a hypothetical bakery that will showcase the products my coworker friend has made for events and in her pastry program. 
She bakes cakes and others baked goods as a personal side job and wanted to do website for her to possibly use and for project requirements. 
The goal is that I can display the products in search option and filters by category, holiday, flavors, types of baked goods, etc... 
Also create customer forms for her people to place orders and have information stored in a database and or event calendar for her to monitor incoming orders online.
